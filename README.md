githubiverse-template
============

This is a Github Page template to show off your 3D printer model or project.  Inspiration clearly taken from the excellent Thingiverse.

Instructions
============

* Create a github project.
* Add and commit content (sources, stl files, images), into separate folders.
* Create an empty gh-pages branch. See http://pages.github.com for further information.
* Copy (not clone!) the contents of this githubiverse-template project into the root directory of the gh-pages branch.
* Edit index.md to define the metadata about the project and choose template preferences in the top yaml section.  Add a description, in markdown format, in the bottom section, or alternatively, use the readme file of the project (see the comments in index.md for details).
* Optionally, modify the html and css to suit your tastes.
* Test locally with jekyll, or commit and push to github.
* When pushed, view at http://yourusername.github.com/yourprojectname, an example project can be seen here: http://garyhodgson.github.com/githubiverse-tst
